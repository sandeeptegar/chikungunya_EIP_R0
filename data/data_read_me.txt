Definitions:


A: dissemination (%) = n(salivary glands)/n(midgut)
B: dissemination (proportion) = proportion of mosquitoes with infectious viruses in the head
C: transmission (proportion) = proportion of mosquitoes with infectious viruses in the saliva
D: dissemination (%) =  percent of individual females with infected legs out of the total number engorged with blood
E: transmission (%) =  the percent of individuals with infected saliva mosquitoes out of the total number of mosquitoes with infected legs
F: dissemination (%) = n(heads)/n(midgut)
G: transmission (%) = n(saliva)/n(heads)
H: dissemination (%) = n(hemocele)/n(midgut)
I: transmission (%) = n(saliva)/n(hemocele)
J: transmission (%) = n(saliva)/n(body-infected) (it is actually n(saliva)/n(infected))
K: percent of blood-fed mosquitoes with virus in hemocoel as indicated by detecting virus in legs and wings
L: percent of blood-fed mosquitoes with virus in saliva

Hemocele is the general cavity or thorax area in mosquitoes.

NOTES:
1. H and I can be considered as F and G respectively, see Bohers et al. 2024.
2. Experimental temperature in Gloria-Soria et al. 2021 was Day:Night = 27:22. We have taken average daily for our purpose, which is 24.5 either 24 or 25.
